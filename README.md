# Terra-usefull-lang
 A collection of usefull Terra sublanguages by Enter1he

This is a Github page for accumulating usefull sublanguages for Terra
programming language. The main idea is to extend Terra in the way it's
only possible in Terra by creating and collecting usefull ideas, realised
in a form of programming languages, that Terra can import and use as a part 
of it's lexer.

## The following repository now contains:

    macro.t - a simplistic macro keyword for replacing unnecessary
    Terra shennanigans with macro(function()) form

    global.t - adds ability to declare lua global variables and tracks thier declaration
    also provides easy to use ability to declare terra globals with a "gvar" keyword
