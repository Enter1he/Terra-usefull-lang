# Terra-usefull-lang
 A collection of usefull Terra sublanguages by Enter1he

This is a Github page for accumulating usefull sublanguages for Terra
programming language. The main idea is to extend Terra in the way it's
only possible in Terra by creating and collecting usefull ideas, realised
in a form of programming languages, that Terra can import and use as a part 
of it's lexer.
